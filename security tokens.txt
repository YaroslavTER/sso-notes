        access token

            issued by an authorization server, and used by a client application in order to access a protected resourse server

            typically in the form of JSON Web Token (JWT)

            the token contains all applicable claims about the subject, enabling the client application to use it as a form of
            credential when accessing a given resourse

            access tokens are only valid for a short period of tine and cannot be revoked

                authorization grant

                    a credential representing the recource owner's authorization to access its protected resources, granted to a client
                    application

                    a client application can use one of the four grant types defined by the OAuth2 Authorization Framework to obtain a grant,
                    depending on client type/requirements

                        authorization code grant

                        client credentials grant

                        implicit grant

                        resource owner password credentials grant

                    the credential returned to the client

                        access token

                        authorization code (exchanged later for an access token)

                User+App

                    "Authorization code" authorization grant

                App-Only

                    "Client credentials" authorization grant

        id token

            can be send along side or instead of an access token, and are used by the client to authenticate the user

        refresh token

            authorization servers will sometimes issues a refresh token at the sate time the access tokes is issued.
            The client application can the exchange this refresh token for a new access token when needed

        authorization code

            a short lived "token" provided to a client application by the authorization endpoint, as part of the "authorization code" flow,
            one of the four OAuth2 authorization grants

            the code is returned to the client application respose to authentication of a resourse owner, indicating the resource owner has delegated
            authorization to access the requested resources

            as part of the flow, the code is later redeemed for an access token
