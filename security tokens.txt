    security tokens

        types

            access token

                issued by an authorization server, and used by a client application in order to access a protected resourse server

                typically in the form of JSON Web Token (JWT)

                the token contains all applicable claims about the subject, enabling the client application to use it as a form of
                credential when accessing a given resourse

                access tokens are only valid for a short period of tine and cannot be revoked

                    authorization grant

                        a credential representing the recource owner's authorization to access its protected resources, granted to a client
                        application

                        a client application can use one of the four grant types defined by the OAuth2 Authorization Framework to obtain a grant,
                        depending on client type/requirements

                            authorization code grant

                            client credentials grant

                            implicit grant

                            resource owner password credentials grant

                        the credential returned to the client

                            access token

                            authorization code (exchanged later for an access token)

                    User+App

                        "Authorization code" authorization grant

                    App-Only

                        "Client credentials" authorization grant

            id token

                can be send along side or instead of an access token, and are used by the client to authenticate the user

                should be used to validate that a user is who they claim to be and get additional useful information about them

                it shouldn't be used for authorization in place of an access token

                the claims it provides can be used for UX inside you application, as keys in a database, and providing access to the client
                application

                claims in an id token

                    id tokens are JWTs, meaning they consist of a header, payload, and signature portion

                    header and signature can be used to verify the authenticity of the token, while the payloads contains the information
                    about the user requested by your client

            refresh token

                authorization servers will sometimes issues a refresh token at the sate time the access tokes is issued.
                The client application can the exchange this refresh token for a new access token when needed

                if the user acess to the app wasn't revoked, it will get back a new access token and a new refresh token

            authorization code

                a short lived "token" provided to a client application by the authorization endpoint, as part of the "authorization code" flow,
                one of the four OAuth2 authorization grants

                the code is returned to the client application respose to authentication of a resourse owner, indicating the resource owner has delegated
                authorization to access the requested resources

                as part of the flow, the code is later redeemed for an access token

        validating security tokens

            the token is signed by the Security Token Server (STS) with a private key. The STS publishes the corresponding public key

            to validate a token, the app verifies the signature bu sing the STS publick key to validate that signature was
            created using private key

            tokens are only valida for a limited amount of time. Usually the Sts provides a pair of tokens:

                an access token to access the application or protected resource

                a refresh token used to refresh the access token when the access token is close to expiring

        JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and claims

            Microsoft identity platform implements security tokens as JWTs that contain claims

            since JWTs are used as security tokens, this form of authentication is sometimes called JWT authentication
