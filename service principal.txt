  service principal

    instead of having applications sign in as a fully privileged user,
    Azure offers service principals

    an Azure service principal is an identity created for use with
    applications, hosted services, and automated tools to access
    Azure resources. This access is restricted by the roles assigned
    to the service principal, giving you control over which resources
    can be accessed and at which level. For security reasons, it's
    always recommended to use service principals with automated tools
    razer than allowing them to log in with a user identity
