    app sign in flow

        on web app navigation

            the web app determines whether the user is authenticated

            if the user isn't authenticated, the web app delegates to Azure AD
            to sign in the user

                may ask the user to enter their creadentials, using multi-factor
                authentication (sometimes refered to as two-factor authentication
                or 2FA), or not useing a password at all


            the user is asked to consent to the access that the client app needs.
            This is why client app need to be registered with Azure AD, so that
            Microsoft identity platform can deliver tokens representing the access
            that the user has consented to

        on successful authentication

            microsoft identity platfowm send a token to the web app

            a cookie is saved, associated with Azure AD's domain, that contains the
            identity of the user in the browser's cookie jar. On the next Microsoft
            identity platform authorization endpoint navigation, the browser
            presents the cookie so that the user doesn't have to sign in again.
            This is also the way that SSO is achieved. The cookie is produced by
            Azure AD and can only be understood by Azure AD

            the web app then validates the token. If the validation succeeds, the
            web app displays the protected page and saves a session cookie in the
            browser's cookie jar. When the user navigates to another page, the web
            app knows that the suer is authenticated based on the session cookie

        delegation sign-in to Microsoft identity platform and token obtaining

            the web app sends an HTP 302 (redirect) to the browser to user Microsoft
            identity platform

            when the user is authenticated, Microsoft identity platform sends the
            token to the web app by using a redirect through the browser

            the redirect is provided by the web app in the form of a redirect URI.
            This redirect URI is registered with the Azure AD application object.
            There can be several redirect URIs because the application my be
            deployed at severa URLs. So the web app will also need to specify
            redirect URI to use

            Azure AD verifies that the redirect URI sent by the web app is one of
            the registered redirect URIs for the app
