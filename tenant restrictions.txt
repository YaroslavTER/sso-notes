    tenancy restrictions

        on authentication process

          Azure Active Directory admin panel

            you can restrict users according tenancy of your application.
            Applies to the case, when you create or invite a new user

          using proxy

            you can restrinc existing userbase to login only
            if email domain match with one of the domains from
            the white list

            how does it works

              on each incoming request proxy sets http headers

              /*
                  what proxy server should I use and why?

                      options that I've found

                          nginx

                          Azure AD Application proxy

                          MC Affe proxy

                  will Azure AD Application proxy be suitable for this task and why?

                  should I build my own proxy server for this purpose?
