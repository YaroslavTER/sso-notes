    redirect URI / reply URL

        is the location where the authorization server send the user once
        the app has been sucsessfully authorized and granted an authorization code
        or accsess token

        the autorization server send the code or token to the redirect URI,
        so it's important you register the correct location as part of the app
        registration process
        
        the following restrictions apply to redirect URIs:

            the redirect URI must begin with the scheme https. There are some
            exceptions for localhost redirect URIs

            the redirect URI is case-sensitive

        maximum number of redirect URIs

            this table shows the maximum number of redirect URIs you can add to
            an app registration in the Microsoft identity platform

                Microsoft work or school accounts in any organization's Azure Active
                Directory (Azure AD) tenant

                    256

                    `signInAudience` field in the application manifest is set to
                    either AzureADMyOrg or AzureADMultipleOrgs

                Personal Microsoft accounts and work and school accounts

                    100

                    `signInAudience` field in the application manifest is set to
                    AzureADandPersinalMicrosoftAccount

        maximum URI length

            you can use a maximum of 256 characters for each redirect URI you add to
            an app registration

        localhost exceptions

            loopback or localhost redirect URIs come with two special considerations

                http URI schemes are acceptable because the redirect never leaves
                the device

                due to ephemeral port ranges often required by native applications,
                the ports component (for example :5001 or :433) is ignored for the
                purposes of matching redirect URI

            from a development standpoint, this means a few things

                do not register multiple redirect URIs where only the port differs.
                the login server will pick one arbitrarily and use the behaviour
                associated with that redirect URI (for example, whether it's a web-,
                native-, or spa- type redirect)

                if ou need to register multiple redirect URIs on localhost to test
                different flows during development, differentiate them using the
                path component of the URI. For example http://127.0.0.1/MyWebApp
                does not match http://127.0.0.1/MyNativeApp

                the IPv6 loopback address ([::1]) is not currently supported

                to prevent your app from being broken by misconfigured firewalls or
                renamed network interfaces, use the IP literal loopback address
                127.0.0.1 in your redirect URI instead of localhost

        restrinctions on wildcards in redirect URIs

            wildcard URIs like https://*.contoso.com should be avoided due to
            secyruty implications

            wildcard URIs currently unsupported in ap registrations configured to
            to sign in personal Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts.
            Wildcard URIs are allowed, however, for apps that are configured to
            to sign in only work or school accounts in an organization's Azure
            AD tenant

        use a state parameter

            if you have several subdomains and your scenario requires that,
            upon successful authentication, you redirect users to the same
            page from witch they started , using a state parameter might be
            helpful

            in this approach

                create a shared redirect URI per application to process the
                security tokens you recieve from the authorization endpoint
                
                your application can send application-specific parameters
                (such as subdomain URL where the user originated or anything
                like branding information) in the state parameter. When using
                a state parameter, guard against CSRF protection

                the application-specific parameters will include all the
                information needed for the application ti rebder the correct
                experiebce for the user, that is, construct the appropriate
                application state. Azure AD authorization endpoint strips
                HTML from the state parameter so make sure you are not passing
                HTML content in the parameter

                where Azure AD sends a response to the shared redirect URI, it
                will send the state parameter back to the application

                the application can then use the value in the satte parameter
                to determine wich URL to further send the user to. Make sure
                you validate from CSRF protection
